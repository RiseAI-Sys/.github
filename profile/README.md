## Introduction

We are the RiseAI Systems Team, a young and energetic group dedicated to building end-to-end AI system stacks spanning both training and inference. Through focused system-level innovations, we strive to make incremental contributions that may serve as a small stepping stone on the long journey toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
